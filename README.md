Easily Customizable: Components clear configuration (e.g., via parameters values), allowing consumers to easily modify layout, style, and behavior without diving into implementation details.
Simple & Intuitive API: Keeping the usage straightforward by abstracting complexity and providing sensible defaults, so components are easy to adopt and reuse.
Avoid Magic Numbers: Replaced hardcoded values with named constants, design tokens and theme-driven values to improve maintainability and scalability.
Responsive by Design: Ensuring components adapting seamlessly across multiple platforms and screen sizes (iOS, iPadOS, macOS) by leveraging layout techniques like GeometryReader.
Readable & Maintainable Code: Prioritizing clarity over cleverness. Using descriptive names, consistent formatting, and modular structures to make the code easier to understand and extend.
